# Llama2 E-commerce Chatbot
This is an E-commerce Chatbot capable of text-to-speech output.<br>
As I don't have a good computer so the entire project is created using Google Colab.
## Specifications
This chatbot requires minimum 8 GB CPU and 8 GB GPU. So, it can run on free Google Colab pretty easily.
## Process
1. I finetuned the Llama-2-7B model with an E-commerce [dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/Andyrasika/Ecommerce_FAQ) and using PEFT to create a QLoRA. The PEFT model is uploaded on HuggingFace hub [here](https://huggingface.co/Phoenix10062002/llama2-faq-chatbot). The whole finetuning process was done on Google Colab. The finetuning notebook is uploaded [here](/Finetuning_Llama2_7B.ipynb) as well.
2. Next, I utilized LangChain to create a chain including the LLM and a prompt template. I didn't add a memory to the chain because it was not working most of the time. Maybe a larger model or more training would have helped.
3. Finally, I used BARK to add text-to-speech functionality in my chatbot. This converts the output generated by the LLM to audio and play in the Google Colab itself.
## Usage
You can open the [chatbot.ipynb](/chatbot.ipynb) file in Google Colab to run the chatbot.<br>
Or, if your local machine meets the desired specification you can run it locally as well using Jupyter notebook.
